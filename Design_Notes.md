# Design Notes

## Key Decisions
1. Architecture choice based on constraints
2. User interface approach
3. Data storage strategy

## Trade-offs
- Performance vs. Complexity
- Features vs. Time to Market
- Scalability vs. Initial Cost

## Constraints Respected
- All constraints from context graph have been considered
- Technical limitations addressed

## Failure Points
- Error handling strategies
- Edge case scenarios
- Recovery mechanisms
